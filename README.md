# ED Helper
ED Helper is a small AHK ([AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)) script for starting [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/), [Elite Observatory](https://github.com/Xjph/EliteObservatory) and [ED Discovery](https://github.com/EDDiscovery/EDDiscovery) and fixing some joytick bindings.

## Installation and Setup
  * Download and install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
  * Download `ED Helper.ahk`.
  * Configure the script by adding the correct program paths and button bindings.
  * Download and configure [JoyFocus](https://github.com/RetroRodent/joyfocus) script if you want to use it.
  * Double click on the script to run it or use the AHK to compile it to an executable.

## Info
The script was created by me after upgrading my controls from X55 Rhino to VPC VIRPIL. 

The issue was that since i play using VR i have mapped some buttons to my X55 HOTAS in order to be able to create screenshots and start/stop nVIDIA Shadowplay if i want to make a video. However because VIRPIL hardware and software works in a different way there is no way to remap the keys or bind them to a macros or a key combination. So i started looking for options, found [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and started experimenting if it will work.

Fortunately for me - it did work and i also found that i can use it to script the starting of all additional tools i use to play ED. As a bonus i found the [JoyFocus](https://github.com/RetroRodent/joyfocus) script, which is prety useful if you play with joysticks and in VR as it makes sure that your game window is always on focus.
